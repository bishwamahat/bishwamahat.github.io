            <p> Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP these were some of free tools i got to know from a reel . You can imagine how back i am , even those minor things were not seen by me 5:57pm 26 Jan 2025 .Now i am going to join BCA Under TU , and the college named ED MARK and Ultimately i have to learn AI ML and keep in mind i have to learn by myself , morning classes from BCA , Afternoon work and at end of day i must get back to my projects and wake up early in the morning , even to spice things up i have my first Sem exam just after a month and i havent seen book , in fact till this day i am unknown about syllabus . I know i can coverup " Nepali ho chance payesi garxa " ill soon give update on my academics , and all of sudden i remembered one incident from my childhood , eventhough i wasn't briiliant kid in class uhh to be honest i was that kind of guy who seems to be a topper but not actually ( thanks to my apperance ) and when i was in grade 8 at that time there were no wifi in my house (we were living in rental room " me , both younger sis and brother " and at that time my mom use to watch serial dramas alot and as i said we dont have any wifi i use to hack neighbours wifi and stand side of the road so that i dont get hit by vehicle or bikes, usully i have to stand like for 2 hours and download by tubebuddy.com from there i was typical wifi hacker ðŸ˜‚. From that time every where i go i use to hack someones wifi and enjoy . and even one time i changed someones wifi name to MY Name and Wifi owner came to my house and compalins to my mom that your child hacked and changed wifi name , idk how i did it but i wasnt able to make back to normal and my mom told me " now police will come and arrest you "as a ciminal . at that time i was so frightenied that i use to whatch down window if i heard some hoen or calling my name . AHH!6:20 . Thsese were one of my story , SEE YLL    </p>
            <P> Today i been to SO called lab of digital logic 1/31/2025 , i really dont have any idea what was student doing , student were using red and black wire , to be specifc they were using justred wire and a eire named jumper, as i was new student i really fuking dont know what was going on , all i know is 0 ,1 and there we have to write it down in order to make lab report " practicle marks " and i think i have to do self study , my xam is just after one month and i only studied some theory , but in lap all theory were out of mind . after one month i am going ro give my 1st sem exam of BCA , ohh shit " i didnt even fill exam form . 10:35AM /P>
